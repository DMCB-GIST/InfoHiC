# 3divv2

## Introduction

3D genome organization is tightly coupled with gene regulation in various biological processes and diseases. 
3D Interaction Viewer and Database (3DIV) is a database providing chromatin interaction visualization in a variety of options from one-to-all chromatin interaction with epigenetic annotation to unique dynamic browsing tools allowing examination of large-scale genomic rearrangement mediated impacts in cancer 3D genome. 
3DIV will be the most comprehensive resource to explore gene regulatory effects of both normal and cancer 3D genome.
